## What is MapCon?

MapCon is a web application designed to help researchers of the Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR) map urban conflicts in the greater Curitiba metropolitan area. The application uses the [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/) library to crawl news websites and collect data on urban conflicts. It then serves the logged data for researches to filter and process, creating a map of the region's conflicts.

### Features under development

- [NLP (Natural Language Processing)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) techniques to extract information from news articles and classify them.
- BI (Business Intelligence) tools to analyze the collected data.
